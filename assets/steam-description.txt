[h1]Overview[/h1]
Would you like more basic districts for your colonies? Perhaps you're tired of being limited by building slots? Then this mods is for you! Adds a Research District, Trade District, Leisure District, Administrative District, and Military District for construction on normal colonies. Also adds an Administrative District and Military District for construction on habitats. All gestalt empires can use Research Districts and Military Districts, but Leisure Districts are only available for Rogue Servitors. Hive Minds, Machines, and Spiritualists have their own versions of the Administrative District.

Due to the addition of Research Districts, Research Labs have been adjusted to function similarly to the Alloy Foundries or Civilian Industries buildings.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Research, Trade, Leisure, Administrative/Ecclesiastical/Synapse/Data Warehouse, and Military Districts are now available for regular colonies. Administrative ([i]et al[/i]) and Military Districts are now also available for construction on habitats. These new districts are considered "city" districts similar to Industrial Districts. In addition, this mod updates Research Labs to function similarly to how Industrial Districts are enhanced (the jobs provided by the district, really) by the Alloy Foundries or Civilian Industries buildings:
[list]
[*]maximum one per planet
[*]all tiers provide 1 head researcher or 2 gestalt researcher jobs
[*]tier 2 increases research output by 1 point (per field) and increases researcher upkeep
[*]tier 3 increases research output by a total of 2 points (per field) and further increases researcher upkeep
[/list]
Along with the new district types, this mod adds new colony designations for Commercial Worlds (focuses on Trade Districts) and Leisure Worlds (focuses on Leisure Districts) as well as updates the Tech-World designation to offer Research District build speed in addition to its existing benefits. Unification Center and Fortress World automation plans are also updated to understand the new district types. Each of the new colony designations features a build automation plan (including Rogue Servitors for Leisure Worlds). The automation plan for Unification Centers, Fortress Worlds, and Tech-Worlds are also adjusted to use the new districts.

All districts respond to changes in civics that alter jobs. For example, Leisure Districts trade Entertainers for a Duelists with Warrior Culture and Ecclesiastical Districts trade a Priest for a Manager for spiritualist megacorps.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Although the districts added by this mod seem similar to existing districts, they are created as new districts so as to not present a compatibility challenge by overwriting many of the district files. The district changes should work with other mods that add or alter districts.

To implement the new research support building (planetary Archives) job bonuses, this mod overwrites the economic category for researchers ([b]planet_researchers[/b]) in order to generate the [b]_add[/b] modifiers for research production (previously only [b]_mult[/b] was available).

Also overwrites all types of Tech-World build automation to use the new Research Districts and include the new research support building.  Unification Center and Fortress World build automation is similarly overwritten.  Thus this mod is incompatible with other mods that also update these build plans.  Commonly this is AI mods - whichever mod loads [i]last[/i] will use its version of these files.


This mod adds a Commercial District which also has been built with compatibility for my mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2641081470]Enhanced Trade Districts and Designations[/url]. Enjoy building commercial enterprises on practically any world.

Built for Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra." Not compatible with achievements. Compatible with Planetary Diversity and follows its exclusions for some colony types. Compatible with Gigastructural Engineering and follows its exclusions for some colony types.

[h3]Not Included in "Subtle Polish"[/h3]
This mod is intentionally not included in my modpack [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2522974089]Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements[/url]; however is fully compatible.

[h3]Required Dependency Mods[/h3]
In order to see and interact with the new district types, it is necessary to use a UI mod that allows more districts to be visible. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1623423360]UI Overhaul Dynamic[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1587178040]Bigger Planet View[/url] are two possible options. If you play Stellaris on a lower resolution (such as 1366x768 or 1600x900) there are not many mod offerings that show many districts without making the planetview too large, so I created [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2654043078]Basic Planetview: More Districts[/url] to address that challenge.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
